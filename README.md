# Codex Discord Remote

Local Discord remote control for Codex Desktop.

This repo lets a Discord bot send messages into local Codex Desktop threads, mirror Codex replies back to Discord, and expose common Codex operations through Discord commands. It is not an official OpenAI client, hosted relay, or npm package. It runs on the user's own machine, where Codex Desktop is already installed, signed in, awake, and trusted.

## AI Agent Brief

- Product: local bridge between Discord and Codex Desktop.
- Main user: a person who wants to operate their local Codex app from Discord.
- Runtime model: Discord bot process plus local Codex Desktop/app-server access.
- Primary platform: Windows 10/11.
- macOS status: native code path exists and macOS GitHub Actions smoke passes, but real GUI control requires Accessibility permission and may still need manual Mac QA on the target machine.
- Linux status: not a desktop-control target.
- Secrets: `.env` contains the Discord bot token and must not be committed.
- Start here when changing code: `codex_discord_bot.py`, `codex_desktop_bridge.py`, `codex_app_server_transport.py`, and the tests matching the touched file.

## Support Matrix

| Platform | Status | Desktop control method | Launcher |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows 10/11 | Primary supported path | Win32 APIs, PowerShell UI Automation, Codex app-server | `.\codex-discord-bot.cmd` |
| macOS | Beta path | AppleScript/System Events, `open`, `pbcopy`, `pbpaste`, Codex app-server | `./codex-discord-bot.sh` |
| Linux | Not supported for Codex Desktop control | None | None |

On macOS, grant Accessibility permission to the terminal app that runs the bot. Without it, System Events cannot focus Codex Desktop, click controls, or send keyboard shortcuts.

## What It Does

- Maps Discord channels and threads to local Codex threads.
- Sends plain Discord messages into the mapped Codex thread.
- Mirrors Codex text, approvals, input prompts, image outputs, and structured file outputs back to Discord.
- Serializes cross-target Codex app turns so one Discord thread does not accidentally abort another.
- Supports slash commands, `!` prefix commands, startup diagnostics, history polling, and Windows tray/watchdog launchers.
- Can run beside other Discord bots. If another bot works in the same Discord thread, mention this bridge when you want local Codex to inspect, steer, or continue that work.

## Setup Overview

1. Create a Discord bot token.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Run the platform installer.
4. Run the token setup script after installation.
5. Invite the bot to the Discord server.
6. Fill the remaining `.env` Discord IDs.
7. Restart Codex Desktop.
8. Start the bot launcher.

The installer can run without the Discord token. Token setup is intentionally post-install so the token is pasted only into the local `.env` file.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 or macOS.
- Python 3.11 or newer.
- Git.
- Codex Desktop installed and signed in.
- Discord bot token.
- Discord server and channel/thread IDs where the bot may read and send messages.
- Discord Developer Portal `Message Content Intent` enabled if plain text messages should be forwarded.

## Create The Discord Bot Token

1. Open <https://discord.com/developers/applications>.
2. Click **New Application**, name it, and create it.
3. Open **Bot** in the left sidebar.
4. Click **Reset Token** or **Copy Token**.
5. In **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable **Message Content Intent**.
6. Save changes.

Keep the token private. Do not paste it into chat, commits, GitHub Actions, or issue comments.

## Install

Clone:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/simdorei/codex-discord-remote.git
cd codex-discord-remote
```

Windows install:

```powershell
.\install.ps1
```

Windows dry run:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -DryRun
```

macOS install:

```sh
./install.sh
```

macOS dry run:

```sh
./install.sh --dry-run
```

If macOS shell scripts are not executable because the repo was copied from a zip file:

```sh
chmod +x ./install.sh ./setup-discord-bot.sh ./codex-discord-bot.sh
```

Installer behavior:

- Installs Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Creates `.env` from `.env.example` if `.env` does not exist.
- Discovers Codex Desktop and writes `CODEX_DESKTOP_EXE` to `.env`.
- Registers the local Codex plugin marketplace when the `codex` command is available.

If the `codex` command is not available, setup still continues. Install the plugin later or set `CODEX_EXE` in `.env`.

## Add Token And Invite Bot

Windows:

```powershell
.\setup-discord-bot.ps1
```

macOS:

```sh
./setup-discord-bot.sh
```

The setup script:

- asks for the Discord bot token with hidden input
- checks the token with Discord
- saves `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` to `.env`
- prints a Discord invite URL

Open the invite URL, choose the Discord server, and authorize the bot. The invite adds the bot to a server; channel access still depends on Discord permissions and `.env` channel IDs.

## Configure `.env`

Turn on Discord **User Settings** -> **Advanced** -> **Developer Mode**. Then right-click the server, channels, threads, and bot user to copy IDs.

Minimum useful settings:

```dotenv
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_discord_server_id
DISCORD_ALLOWED_CHANNEL_IDS=channel_or_thread_id
DISCORD_STARTUP_CHANNEL_ID=channel_id_for_startup_notice
DISCORD_ENABLE_MESSAGE_CONTENT=1
DISCORD_PLAIN_ASK_MENTION_USER_IDS=your_bridge_bot_user_id
DISCORD_SESSION_MIRROR=1
DISCORD_ENABLE_ATTACHMENTS=1
CODEX_DESKTOP_EXE=
CODEX_EXE=
PYTHON_EXE=
```

Important fields:

| Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Secret bot token. Filled by the setup script. |
| `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` | Discord server ID. |
| `DISCORD_ALLOWED_CHANNEL_IDS` | Comma-separated allowlist of channel or thread IDs. |
| `DISCORD_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` | Discord user IDs only. Required for host reboot commands. |
| `DISCORD_ENABLE_HOST_COMMANDS` | Default `0`. Keep disabled unless trusted users are allowlisted. |
| `DISCORD_PLAIN_ASK_MENTION_USER_IDS` | Bot user IDs that must be mentioned for plain ask routing outside mapped threads. |
| `DISCORD_SESSION_MIRROR` | Mirrors mapped Codex session output back into Discord. |
| `DISCORD_ENABLE_ATTACHMENTS` | Saves Discord attachments and includes local paths in Codex prompts. |
| `CODEX_EXE` | Optional path to Codex CLI/app-server executable. |
| `CODEX_DESKTOP_EXE` | Optional path to Codex Desktop executable. Installer tries to fill it. |
| `PYTHON_EXE` | Optional Python executable override. |

Do not commit `.env`.

## Run

Windows visible launcher:

```powershell
.\codex-discord-bot.cmd
```

Windows headless launcher:

```powershell
wscript.exe .\codex-discord-bot-headless.vbs
```

Windows watchdog:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\codex-discord-watchdog.ps1
```

The watchdog restarts the headless bot if the bot is missing. It also restarts the bot after repeated unhealthy host samples: CPU at or above `95%`, free memory at or below `768MB`, for `2` consecutive checks. Tune those checks with `-HealthCpuPercent`, `-HealthFreeMemoryMb`, and `-HealthBadSampleLimit`. Put `.codex_discord_bot.disabled` in the repo root to pause watchdog restarts.

macOS launcher:

```sh
./codex-discord-bot.sh
```

Logs:

- bot log: `codex_discord_bot.log`, unless `CODEX_DISCORD_LOG_PATH` is set
- launcher log: `discord_launcher.log`

## Install Or Reinstall Codex Plugin

The installer normally registers the local plugin marketplace. Manual commands:

```powershell
codex plugin marketplace add .
codex plugin add codex-discord-remote@codex-discord-remote
```

Confirm:

```powershell
codex plugin marketplace list
codex plugin list
```

Expected entries:

- marketplace: `codex-discord-remote`
- plugin: `codex-discord-remote@codex-discord-remote`

Restart Codex Desktop after installing the plugin so bundled skills load into new sessions.

## Discord Command Surface

Registered Discord slash commands:

- /help, /list, /archived_list, /use, /status, /settings, /doctor, /where, /context, /usage, /runners, /retract, /mirror_check, /bridge_sync, /new, /ask, /interview (legacy alias: /ask_ipc)

Common slash commands:

- `/help`
- `/list`
- `/status`
- `/doctor`
- `/where`
- `/context`
- `/usage`
- `/new`
- `/ask`
- `/interview`

Common prefix commands:

- `!help`
- `!list`
- `!archived_list`
- `!use`
- `!open`
- `!open_abort`
- `!stop`
- `!status`
- `!settings`
- `!doctor`
- `!discover_codex`
- `!restart_codex`
- `!chatid`
- `!where`
- `!context`
- `!usage`
- `!runners`
- `!resources`
- `!retract`

- `!mirror`
- `!approval`
- `!archive`
- `!archive-used`
- `!delete_archive`
- `!confirm_delete_archive`
- `!new`
- `!interview`

Numeric refs follow the same DB-root numbering as `!list`.

See [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md) for daily workflow details.

## Send Files To Discord

For one-off files, use the helper instead of pasting binary data or saying file delivery is unavailable:

```powershell
py -3 .\send_discord_attachment.py --thread-ref repo:2 --content-file .\caption.txt .\result.zip
```

Use `--thread-ref` for a mirrored Codex thread, `--work-thread` for a specific Codex thread id/ref, or `--channel-id` when you already know the Discord channel/thread id. Put Korean or multiline captions in a UTF-8 text file and pass it with `--content-file`.

## Routing And Mirror Rules

- A mapped Discord thread follows its matching Codex app thread.
- Plain Discord messages inside a mapped thread go to that mapped Codex thread, not the currently selected Codex tab.
- Codex text output mirrors as Discord text.
- Codex image and structured file output mirrors as Discord attachments.
- Local file uploads are limited to `.codex-remote-attachments` to avoid uploading unrelated files.
- `STOP REPLY` means the Codex app's current response stop button.
- Discord `!stop` is a bot command and is not the same thing as `STOP REPLY`.
- Messages from other bots are ignored unless they explicitly mention this bridge user.

Prefer changing the shared helper used by all callers instead of patching one command path.

## Validation

Windows/local smoke:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\plugins\codex-discord-remote\scripts\qa-smoke.ps1
```

Focused Python tests:

```powershell
py -3 -m unittest tests.test_setup_discord_bot tests.test_codex_desktop_bridge_desktop_process tests.test_codex_desktop_bridge_macos_input
```

macOS CI smoke runs on push and pull request:

```text
.github/workflows/macos-smoke.yml
```

The macOS smoke workflow checks Python compilation, selected unit tests, `install.sh --dry-run`, and `setup-discord-bot.sh --dry-run`.

## Troubleshooting

`Codex CLI was not found`

- Install or enable the `codex` command, or set `CODEX_EXE` in `.env`.
- Bot setup can still continue without plugin registration.

`Discord messages are ignored`

- Check `DISCORD_ENABLE_MESSAGE_CONTENT=1`.
- Check Message Content Intent in the Discord Developer Portal.
- Check `DISCORD_ALLOWED_CHANNEL_IDS`.
- In non-mapped channels, mention the bridge user if `DISCORD_PLAIN_ASK_MENTION_USER_IDS` is set.

`macOS cannot click or focus Codex`

- Grant Accessibility permission to the terminal app running `codex-discord-bot.sh`.
- Keep Codex Desktop installed, signed in, awake, and visible at least once.

`Windows desktop control cannot find Codex`

- Run `.\install.ps1 -DryRun`.
- Set `CODEX_DESKTOP_EXE` in `.env` if discovery cannot find the app.
- Run `.\codex-discord-bot.cmd` from the repo root.
