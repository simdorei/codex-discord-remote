## Bundled Skills And Attribution

The Codex Discord Remote plugin packages these skills. In Codex, the fully qualified
skill names use the `$codex-discord-remote:<skill-name>` form. In Discord,
some skills also have slash or `!` command wrappers.

| Skill | Purpose | Discord entrypoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `discord-remote` | Operational runbook for this local Discord bridge: bot status, watchdog restarts, archive-lock recovery, mirror routing checks, log triage, and local deployment checks. | No direct skill wrapper; use the normal remote commands such as `!status`, `!doctor`, `!mirror check`, and `!bridge sync`. |
| `discord-remote-qa` | Focused QA checklist for mirror mapping, context refresh, session mirror cursor priming, steering suppression, archive lock retry, and deployment readiness. | No direct skill wrapper; use it from Codex when validating remote changes. |
| `archive-used` | Bulk archive workflow for Codex threads whose `used` value in bridge list output is at or above a user-provided `<threshold>`, targeting the UUID printed in each selected list row. | `!archive-used <threshold>` invokes the skill from Discord; Codex then uses local bridge list/archive commands or the equivalent `!list` and `!archive <uuid-from-list>`. |
| `deep-interview` | Clarification-first requirements workflow. It confirms the work structure, asks one question at a time, scores ambiguity, preserves the user's language, tracks scope/entities/constraints, and stops at a pending-approval ticket before implementation. | `/interview <request>` or `!interview <request>`. |

- `deep-interview` is adapted from the Gajae Code deep-interview skill:
  https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/src/defaults/gjc/skills/deep-interview
- Gajae Code is MIT licensed. The packaged notice is at

- Repository-level third-party notices are collected in `NOTICE.md`.

Useful plugin-backed scripts can also be run directly from the repository:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\plugins\codex-discord-remote\scripts\status.ps1
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\plugins\codex-discord-remote\scripts\restart.ps1
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\plugins\codex-discord-remote\scripts\qa-smoke.ps1 -SkipUnitTests
```

`restart.ps1` queues a deferred restart by default. The watchdog waits until every DB-root
Codex thread is `idle` and no listed thread has recent activity before stopping the bot, so
the current Discord-mirrored turn can finish. Use `-DryRun` to check readiness or `-Immediate`
when you intentionally want the script to wait in the foreground.
